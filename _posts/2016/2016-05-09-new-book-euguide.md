Today I published a new book on European politics. I believe this is a much better piece of work than my previous publication in that it is more descriptive than prescriptive.

Here is the [book's index](/euguide/), with links to each of its parts. And here is its [print-optimised version](/euguide/print/)—the single-webpage view—for those who wish to keep a physical copy.

The *Little Guide to the European Union* is delivered to the public free of charge. This book is for a general audience, though specialists may find it useful as well.[^CodeDiaryNote]

For further information, please [contact me](/contact/). Also, and if interested, do not forget to [follow this website](/follow/). I will continue publishing regularly on the EU.

[^CodeDiaryNote]: For a "behind the scenes" look into the writing of this book, read today's diary entry: [On writing my new book](/diary/writing-euguide/). If interested in the underlying code of the *Little Guide*, read today's Codelog entry: [How I coded my new book](/codelog/euguide-code/).
