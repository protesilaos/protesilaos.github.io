*Seabed* is a low contrast colour scheme inspired by the deep sea. It is special among my theme collection in that its two variants are essentially dark (in contrast to distinct light and dark versions). The difference between the two is one of degree: a dark and a 'lighter' dark. There is no pure red, orange, and yellow, while the rest of the palette hints heavily towards the blue side of the spectrum.
