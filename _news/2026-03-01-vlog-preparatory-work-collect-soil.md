In this 30-minute video I show some of the work I am doing at the back
side of my land. I need to collect soil for some infrastructure
project. To do this, I must first tear down a small side of the
mountain. Then I can collect the soil using the shovel and the
handcart to move it where it needs to be. This is a small piece of a
larger project that will keep me busy for several days. It is
important to have all that done for the long-term viability of my stay
here in my land.
