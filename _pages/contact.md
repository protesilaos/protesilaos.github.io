Feel free to send me your message regarding the content of this website (blog posts, coding stuff, books, etc.).

I will also consider any job offer on the basis of my current program and its relevance to my work.

## PGP encryption for emails (optional)

Grab my key from the server with the following command:

```shell
gpg --recv-keys A5B8A16D86ADECB21FB8D488BF48FD84FE21D72A
```

Or download and then import the file [protesilaos-stavrou-public.key](/pages/certificates/protesilaos-stavrou-public.key).

This key is valid as of 2017-06-03. Any older key should be discarded.

I encourage you to learn how to use encryption for your email communications. You can get started with this excellent guide on [email self-defence](https://emailselfdefense.fsf.org/en/).
