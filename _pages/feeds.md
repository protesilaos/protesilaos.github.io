There are three types of regular updates on this website. Each has its own feed, as it caters to a different audience.

- Blog on [European Union politics](https://protesilaos.com/feed.xml)
- Coding blog about [web development and GNU/Linux](https://protesilaos.com/codelog.xml)
- Πολιτικές [αναλύσεις στα ελληνικά](https://protesilaos.com/greek.xml) (political writings in greek)

## What is a feed anyway?

It is a stream of data that is read by a specialised application, a feed reader. The feed is updated every time the website pushes some new piece of content. In my case that would be a new article.
