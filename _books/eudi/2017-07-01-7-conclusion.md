The *Dialogues on EU politics* is a different take on my corpus of political analysis. I have used fictional characters to convey my ideas in a dialogical format. My hope is that the dialogue is more entertaining to read than a series of essays. Perhaps it also turns out to be more didactic. 

I find the dialogue superior to the essay in at least one important respect. It makes the thinking process more evident. Apart from the actual arguments, one can follow along with the rationale. It thus is possible that readers will arrive at different conclusions than the ones presented herein. That is a feature of the dialogical format I much appreciate.

The *Dialogues* is, for the most part, a piece of theoretical work. It is rather abstract. There are relatively few references to day-to-day political issues, party politics, and the kind of affairs that influence the agenda. I think a blog is better suited for technical analyses on rapidly evolving states of affairs. A book seems more appropriate for inquiries into the structure of things, the patterns, the qualities that remain constant or which are less likely to change over extended periods of time. Bar some allusions to current events, this book can be read in the summer of 2017 or in 2020 and still be relevant. That is how I would like it to be.
