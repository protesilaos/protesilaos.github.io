**UPDATE 2018-06-23:** This post is out of date.  
I have since switched full time to Arch Linux and now Debian Sid. I currently use a highly customised environment around `bspwm` (still need to adapt it to Debian Sid). I think `bspwm` is better than `i3wm` because it has cleaner configs and some extra features (such as key chord chains, which greatly expand the number of shortcuts you can set). See my rather elaborate [dotfiles](https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles) for more.  
As for this article, I have added an Annex with an annotated version of my latest `i3-gaps` config file. You will need to have a close look at it and make adaptations where necessary.  
For the sake of completeness, [this is the commit that removed i3](https://github.com/protesilaos/dotfiles/commit/aba729fed45939b3f1fbf00f68aae67ae784d415) from my dotfiles.

My favourite desktop environment is Xfce. It is lightweight, customisable, and strikes the right balance between stability and usability. The one area where I find it somewhat constraining is on window placement. The options provide for either an effectively random placement of new windows on the screen, or for them to appear at the centre. On a large monitor either option is suboptimal. Random placement introduces a noticeable mental disconnect of trying to anticipate the position of the new window. While central positioning grows inefficient when opening multiple applications, since each new window has to be moved out of the other's way.

Xfce's default window manager follows a 'stacking' paradigm. Windows are piled on top of each other. Two or more windows can cover the same screen region. The onus of window management thus falls on the user. They need to use `Alt+Tab` or click the relevant window button on the panel in order to get to where they want. This is a traditional approach that perfectly suited smaller monitors of the past. In our age though, where 24" and higher screens are all too common, there is no practical necessity to run a stacking window manager. We can instead instruct the display server to position windows next to each other, saving us from the extra effort.

That is where programs such as i3 come into play. This is a window manager whose headline feature is the 'tilling' placement of applications. Equally important is its keyboard-centric approach. One can use i3 with virtually no mouse interaction. All operations on the workspace can be done with a few simple key strokes, from opening windows, to moving/tiling them in the desired place, to adjusting their relative widths. Working on a large monitor and making best use of its expansive real estate, becomes part of the ordinary computing experience.

On a small canvas, the added value of tiling windows is partially lost, especially for applications such as the web browser that will only display a portion of the whole website (since many are not well designed for narrower viewports). But with a monitor above 21", it is very convenient to run two windows side by side or have a 2x2 grid that does not detract from the overall experience. For terminals, this is even more so, since the text will always fit the viewport.

## i3 with gaps

My new monitor is 27" on the diagonal. Running a tiling window manager on it is the best choice I could make. Window placement is predictable, while the large screen can easily accommodate several applications running on the same desktop. Combined with a smooth way of handling workspaces (virtual desktops), i3 offers all one needs to get things done from the comfort of their keyboard.

The only limitation of i3 proper is its lack of some essential features, most notably the option to have gaps between windows and margins on the workspace. The [i3-gaps fork](https://github.com/Airblader/i3) rectifies that, while adding a straightforward way to resize gaps on the fly and even to predefine gaps for specific workspaces. Having tried both i3 and i3-gaps, I can only the recommend the latter, especially on larger monitors (though technically one can run it on small screens just as fine).

## Debian does not offer i3-gaps

The official repos only include the main i3 package. To get the fork with the gaps one needs to compile it from source. The maintainer's instructions are clear and easy to follow. Getting i3 with gaps on Debian stretch (still the current testing) only takes a few minutes.

Fortunately enough, Debian repos do include other pieces of software that are useful to a comprehensive i3 setup, namely, `rofi`, `i3blocks`, and `feh`. To that mix we might as well add `compton`, `unclutter`, and `setxkbmap`.

## Worth the time investment

It took me about a day to get things configured the way I want them, while I am still tweaking some minor things here and there. This might seem like a huge investment in time and effort, but in truth it is comparable to the time I need to customise my Xfce desktop.

With about a full week on i3-gaps I can confidently claim that a tilling window manager is the best option for a workflow that (i) focuses on the keyboard, (ii) makes window placement predictable and thus minimises perceived friction, and (iii) is highly customisable and can deliver a very personalised experience.

So here is a screenshot of what I am actually seeing right now.

In the future I might also produce a video to better demonstrate my workflow. In the meantime, feel free to [use my dotfiles](https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dofiles).

## UPDATE 2018-06-23: Annex

Below is the latest version of my i3 config file with some new comments that might prove useful:

```sh
# vi:ft=i3
# i3 config file (v4)

# UPDATE 2018-06-23
    # IMPORTANT I stopped using i3 about six months ago. Today is 23 June 2018.
    #
    # This config is retrieved from the git history of my dotfiles
    # https://github.com/protesilaos/dotfiles/commit/aba729fed45939b3f1fbf00f68aae67ae784d415
    #
    # This config is updated to provide basic support for this article:
    # https://protesilaos.com/codelog/i3-gaps-debian/ (10 June 2017)
    #
    # All new comments (2018-06-23) start with the term UPDATE and are indented
    #
    # Furthermore, I have replaced all shotcuts that used the Alt key (Mod1).
    # Those would have conflicted with Emacs (and perhaps others).
    # If you do not use Emacs, feel free to replace Shift or Mod4 (Meta).
    #
    # Finally, I have removed the icon paths in the notify-send actions.
    # Those were hard wired to the Papirus icon theme.
    # Bad practice.
    # I recently found out that the icon names can be generic.
    # They will use the active icon theme.
    # Example:
    # notify-send -i firefox "Notification title" "Notification text"
    #
    # Adapt accordingly.

# General settings
# ==============================================================================

# UPDATE 2018-06-23
    # Assign the $mod key to Super/Meta (the Windows key)
    # Use Mod1 if you prefer the Alt key
    # The $mod is critical for interacting with the i3 window manager
set $mod Mod4

# UPDATE 2018-06-23
    # This does not seem correct. It was probably placed here by accident.
    # I have commented it out, to avoid any errors. Please test.
    # Also, I recommend you use Hack instead of DejaVu Sans Mono.
    # They are almost the same, but Hack looks a bit cleaner.
# font pango:DejaVu Sans Mono 8

# UPDATE 2018-06-23
    # These are useful if you keep editing the i3 files regularly
    # If I remember correctly, only the `restart` command had guaranteed results.
    # Test it.
# i3 config file
bindsym $mod+Shift+c reload
bindsym $mod+Shift+r restart

# Colour scheme
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# UPDATE 2018-06-23
    # If you do not like the following approach, define colours here.
    # Use the following syntax: set $[variable name] [colour hex value]
    # Example:
    # set $black #000000
    #
    # I recommend you have a look at those two pages, if you need inspiration.
    # https://protesilaos.com/schemes
    # https://protesilaos.com/tempus-themes
    #
    # Relying on Xresources is good for using one palette for many programs.
    # But it means you have to edit separate files.
    # You need to keep things well organised. I do that in my current dotfiles.
    # See https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles
    #
    # Also, it may not be easy to migrate to Sway (basically i3 for Wayland).
    # Have not tried it, so this is just an assumption (Xresources is for Xorg).

# UPDATE 2018-06-23
    # You need to adapt the autostarting of the URxvt server.
	# You add this to ~/.xprofile, ~/.profile, or within the i3 config
	# Depends on how you login. Test it.
	#
	# The code for autostarting the URxvt server (if you call it from a shell)
    #
    # # start URxvt server
	# if [ -x /usr/bin/urxvtd ]; then
	#     urxvtd --quiet --opendisplay --fork &
	# fi
    #
    # Within i3 just use:
    # exec --no-startup-id urxvtd --quiet --opendisplay --fork &
    #
	# A very good alternative for URxvt is xfce4-terminal.
    # If you use that, cli programs are called with this:
    # xfce4-terminal -x PROGRAM

# UPDATE 2018-06-23
    # Programs such as qutebrowser and newsboat are not in Debian Stretch
    # You need to change these accordingly
    #
    # Also, the way I defined those variables could probably be improved.
    # For example:
    # set $term TERMINAL
    # set $term-cli TERMINAL -x
    # set $fm $term-cli ranger
    #
    # Cannot test whether this would work. Please test.

# NOTE urxvtd is started with ~/.xprofile, which is sourced from ~/.xinitrc
# NOTE this is necessary for logging in with a display manager
# NOTE the daemon is launched before i3 to speed up the opening of terminals
set $term urxvtc
set $browser qutebrowser
