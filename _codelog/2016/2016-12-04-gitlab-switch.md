I want to make a couple of announcements:

1. My [website's source code](https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/protesilaos.gitlab.io) is now hosted on GitLab.
2. All pages are heretofore served via a secure connection (`https` instead of `http`).

I first learned about GitLab from [Changelog episode 220](https://changelog.com/podcast/220). I created an account shortly thereafter but failed to do anything with it. I was/am on GitHub so the idea of migrating my projects over to this new service did not seem appealing.

But then Chromium (Google Chrome) [announced](https://blog.chromium.org/2016/09/moving-towards-more-secure-web.html) that it will soon favour websites with secure protocols. I expected GitHub Pages (where I previously hosted my site) to follow suit: to provide users with the option of setting up a certificate for their custom domains. As of this writing, they have not done so. GitLab does.

There was my reason. Today I had some free time, so I committed to make all the necessary arrangements for the switch and the transition to the secure protocol. Everything appears to be working fine. I am happy and looking forward to exploring GitLab's features.
