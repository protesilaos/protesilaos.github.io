I shall proceed to write this short blog post in the following way: I will first put forward a suggestion on the topic concerned. I will then follow up with a series of remarks whose aim is to examine the stated claims. The intention is to conclude with a distinction between _ultimate_ and _proximate_ objectivity.

## Suggestion

For a thing to be defined, to be properly named and clearly delineated _as it is_ in juxtaposition to others as they are,  a criterion has to be identified and clearly consider as such. A definition rests on objectivity. Should the criterion be variable _as against the thing_, no definitive consideration would be possible, for what would once appear as something could manifest as an other, potentially differentiable to itself.

## Remarks

1) The above suggestion, if treated in terms of ultimates, raises the following question: **_by what means is the criterion recognised as such?_** To define something as a criterion, a _criterion_ is necessary, otherwise the use of _this _over the _that_ would essentially be arbitrary. Arbitrariness prevents the demarcation of the true from the non-true.

2) An intentional election of one over a possible multitude, does imply the operation of _something_ qua criterion that informs, if not _conditions_, that choice. By &#8216;choice&#8217; I mean a decision that follows from a consideration of certain parameters, making it, at the very least, &#8220;less&#8221; arbitrary proximate to total arbitrariness.

3) In terms of choice and always with respect to the consideration of ultimates, the choosing subject _as such_ needs to be brought under scrutiny. Is the subject that would select a criterion, an ultimate criterion in itself? If not, then how can it be known _by the subject _and with _ultimately certainty_ that the criterion thus selected is the definitive one? If yes, then the criterion is, in truth, none other than the subject itself; for even if we were to refer to a given faculty of the subject and obscure from our consideration all other capacities or functions peculiar to it, we would still not avoid finding the criterion in the subject. Should that be so, we would, nolens volens, be led to the conclusion that the subject qua criterion is the determinant of objectivity or identical to it.

4) By &#8216;subject&#8217; I do not refer to some exalted individual human being with extraordinary faculties of comprehension; one that alone can pierce the veil of phenomenality (or escape from the mould of opinion) to define things as they are. I only refer to _the subject of first philosophy_, to the _thinker_ who can ever think of the _world_ and the _thinkable_ — of the _&#8220;two magnitudes of an otherwise singular reality&#8221;_, as I claim in my last philosophical essay, the Notes on the Thinkable: Version 2.0.

5) Even if the subject were to be appreciated as the criterion, the initial question would still not be answered, or it would be answered in a circular manner of argument. To the present author, it thus seems that in terms of ultimates, the operation of another criterion for identifying a criterion, is a regress ad infinitum. And yet, our experience, our very comprehension of it, suggests that _some_ objectivity can be identified. It may then be the case that the consideration of ultimates, is at bottom, an imprecise statement, or an inadequate method of inquiry.

6) Perhaps we can posit that we make use of _proximate_ objectivity, such as when we do science and philosophy. Indeed some criteria apply and, in the context of this blog post, one need not be enumerative about them. The concern here is that we cannot know, with ultimate certainty and with the use of these criteria, whether _they_ are ultimates in themselves, or whether they are considered as objective points of reference or benchmarks relative to all that we can think of the world and the thinkable; and, hence, to all that we can think of the criteria as such. Note that by using the term &#8216;posit&#8217; I acknowledge that my proposition makes no claim to ultimate certainty, but only to what _appears_ to be the case in what is (or may be) within my reach.

## Conclusion

Granted the aforementioned and the discussion on ultimates notwithstanding, I would argue that **objectivity concerns the constancy of the criterion _relative_ to the consideration.** Such constancy need not be constant per se but _only_ as regards the consideration. Any definition must then follow from that.
