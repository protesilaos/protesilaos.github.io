In _Meno_, one of <a title="Plato's Meno" href="http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/meno.html" target="_blank">Plato&#8217;s dialogues on the nature of virtue</a>, Socrates and Meno engage in a discussion concerning the value of knowledge, so as to establish the reason _it_ is preferable to an opinion. One of the scenarios considered, involves a traveller who intends to visit Larissa and ventures to ask for directions: in one case, someone would make use of a _belief__ _of theirs concerning the location of Larissa to opine on the road leading to it and would eventually be found correct in the directions provided; while another case would have a person who would resort to their _knowledge_ of the exact location of Larissa to mark the way leading to it, also to be found correct in their statement.

Through the dialogue, Socrates and Meno suggest that knowledge is of a higher epistemic value, for it rests on firm foundations and, hence, it is likely to remain constant, always yielding the expected result(s); whereas an opinion might have been right for a number of contingent reasons and, given that it is not predicated on sound foundations, may be subject to change should the factors contributing to its correctness no longer [inter]operate in the specific way(s) that engendered such a truth. An opinion, albeit a true one in a given context, is appreciated as generally _unreliable_ relative to knowledge and is therefore regarded as having a lesser epistemic value.

Granted this value scale holds; how are we to attach epistemic value to propositions? Can value of this sort be determined ex ante and, if so, in which cases? Where _true opinion_ and _knowledge_ yield the same result, how can a distinction be drawn between them? Is there a variance in the degree of [discernibility](https://protesilaos.com/tag/discernibility/ "Posts tagged with "Discernibility") peculiar to each of these two epistemic categories in case they deliver the same result?

## Of form and constitution

Let us begin delving into the matter by considering the distinction between the _form_ and the _constitution_ of a case: a statement _p_ standing for _&#8220;deliver these documents&#8221;_ is presented to us for examination. We surmise that the _form_ of this statement consists of agent _x_ instructing patient _y_ to act _w_. To further examine the actual, qualitative relations between the facts, we proceed to assess the _constitution_ of the case, such as through the following two examples:

  * If the relationship between the agent and the patient is one of hierarchy, then the agent is _**issuing an order** _that is expected to be complied with by the patient on the basis of certain roles that establish and inform the hierarchy between them. Let this constitution of the case be _C1_.
  * Should another kind of relation between the agent and the patient be hypothesised, of say a gunman _x_ threatening the patient _y_ to _p _[deliver these documents], then _x_ is in fact **_ordering_** _y_, and hence our consideration can no longer factor in any kind of structured hierarchy between their roles, but must rather account for the coercion involved. Let this be _C2_.

In addition, we have to draw clear delineations between two types of assessment we may make: (1) the _general_ and (2) the _particular_:

  1. Regarding the former, we can suggest that all _p_ qua _p_ will _always_ and _necessarily_ amount to our formal understanding of it, where _x_ instructs _y_ to act _w_. That is an _analytic_ category derived from the statement itself, which is epistemologically (though _not_ metaphysically) _a priori_. Whenever it is stipulated that the form of that _p _remains the same, our analytic assessment of it will always be constant and so will its truthfulness, _regardless_ of the specificities peculiar to the constitution of the case.
  2. As for the latter, we require empirical data to determine whether _C1_ or _C2_  or any possible _Cz_ is truthful _in the case_. Factoring in to our consideration the one that corresponds to the _actual_ state of affairs, will yield us a context-specific knowledge that is _synthetic_ as it encompasses both the formal and the constitutional understanding of the case. That would be an epistemologically _a posteriori_ category.

Both (1) and (2) _as described_ would amount to knowledge, if we were to follow the classification of Plato/Socrates. An _opinion_ relating to them could only be held by obfuscating the distinction between the general and the particular, specifically where a certain formulation of _p_ would take _Cz_ as constant, therefore elevating a particularised knowledge into a generalised one. The truth correspondence of that — its epistemic value — would be dubious or rather indeterminable ex ante, for the formulation of the statement would be assuming _necessary_ constancy in the [inter]operation of the facts in all possible states of affairs, essentially transfiguring a _judgement_ about a certain constitution into a formal relation, decisively obliterating the distinction between them. Put differently, it would be treating an _a posteriori _assessment as _a priori _certainty by identifying the form with the constitution.

Opinions can be held for a variety of considerations, regarding the form or the constitution of the case, the general or the particular assessment delivered. To conclude this first note on the topic, I would therefore tend to prefer considering judgements as partaking of varying degrees of _suboptimal_ reliability, willing to put them to the test in the way they may be testable, rather than dismiss them in advance. Let their classification into knowledge or credence follow thenceforth.
