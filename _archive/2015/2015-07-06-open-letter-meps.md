Honourable Member,

In my capacity as a European citizen, I have been examining the events peculiar to Greece&#8217;s adjustment programme. I am concerned about the crisis in Greece—including the way it is handled—due to the possible ramifications on the process of European integration.

In this light, I have witnessed reports on President Martin Schulz&#8217;s campaign to influence the outcome of the July 5 referendum in Greece. For the record, I furnish links to eminent media outlets, such as <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/05/us-eurozone-greece-schulz-idUSKCN0PF06O20150705" target="_blank">Reuters</a>, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11718296/EU-warns-of-Armageddon-if-Greek-voters-reject-terms.html" target="_blank">The Telegraph</a>, and <a href="http://www.politico.eu/article/schulz-greece-campaign-yes-greferendum-grexit-vote-eurozone-parliament-president/" target="_blank">Politico Europe</a>.

Assuming the validity of those reports, I wish to remind you of <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+RULES-EP+20150428+RULE-022+DOC+XML+V0//EN&language=EN&navigationBar=YES" target="_blank">Rule 22(4)</a> of the European Parliament&#8217;s Rules of Procedure, on the _Duties of the President_:

> Parliament shall be represented in international relations, on ceremonial occasions and in administrative, legal and financial matters by the President, who may delegate these powers.

As well as <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+RULES-EP+20150428+RULE-223+DOC+XML+V0//EN&language=EN&navigationBar=YES" target="_blank">Rule 223</a> on the _Powers and responsibilities of the President_:

> The President shall represent Parliament in its relations with political parties at European level, in accordance with Rule 22(4).

Furthermore, I wish to state the fact that the European Parliament does not partake in the negotiations on Greece&#8217;s reform programme and, a fortiriori, its President has no institutional role in the process.

The active and partisan media presence of President Schulz brings into question the boundaries of the aforementioned Rules. As such, I wish to forward the following non-exhaustive list of questions:

  * Is the President&#8217;s rhetoric representative of the European Parliament&#8217;s official position?
  * Are his exhortations consistent with his function and duties as President of the European Parliament?
  * Will questions be raised concerning this very topic during the July Plenary session?

I, as a European citizen, expect the Parliament to treat these issues with the appropriate care and responsibility, also with respect to the outcome of the referendum in Greece.

Sincerely Yours,

Protesilaos Stavrou
