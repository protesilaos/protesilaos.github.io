**This post is outdated.** I am back on [Twitter @protstavrou](https://twitter.com/protstavrou). Browse through my website to see the new content I have been posting.

My Twitter days are over. I will delete my account.[^DeleteSocial] This decision will enter into force on April 24, 2016 at 0700 CET, only so that it does not come as a total surprise. Please do not tweet back at me. I will not see your message.

The handles to be affected are two:

- [@prot_stavrou ](https://twitter.com/prot_stavrou) which was my actual profile.
- [@Protes_Stavrou](https://twitter.com/protes_stavrou) which I had created by mistake.

Through Twitter I got to share my thoughts with people outside my circle of acquaintances. Almost all of the accounts I followed were of individuals I had never met and probably never will. I gathered valuable information out of the items they shared. I even was fortunate enough to come across some like-minded persons.[^JournalArticle]

Coming to the disadvantages that ultimately shaped my decision, these can be enumerated thus:

1. **Addictive usage**: I realised that I was checking the app/website multiple times per day. This is time I could have spent reading, writing, coding, or just going out for a walk.
2. **Limited interaction**: I oftentimes felt as though I was tweeting to the void. Zero feedback. This probably has to do with who I am, what I would share, the timing of my tweets, and so on. Whatever the case, I would rather not change my behaviour for a social network.
3. **Irrelevance of the service**: Twitter offers too little and asks for too much in return. I receive the news directly from media outlets, while I follow websites that interest me by subscribing to their content feed ("RSS"). The only use case for Twitter was to share links to my writings.

I have no alter-Twitter, at least not for the time being. If you are still interested, there are ways to [contact me](/contact/) and/or [follow my work](/follow/). I understand these may prove inadequate or inconvenient to a Twitter user. My apologies.

As for this website, it remains my only real commitment on the Internet.

Peace.

[^DeleteSocial]: Update, May 9, 2016: I created a new Twitter handle ([@protstavrou](https://twitter.com/protstavrou)) only for receiving messages regarding the content of this website, i.e. as an alternative to email. I no longer am active on Twitter, as described in this post.

[^JournalArticle]: Though quite a few, I wish to single out—and hereby express my gratitude to—Lluís Camprubi ([@lluiscamprubi](https://twitter.com/lluiscamprubi)) who found me via Twitter and eventually asked for my contribution to the journal of the Catalan Greens. My article was published on January 26, 2016 with the title *"Europe’s economic governance: context and reform prospects"*. It [was republished](/economic-governance-context-reform/) a day later on this website.
